      I'm a sophmore at MNHS. I'm the
      oldest of three and have a younger
      sister and brother. I started coding
      when I was 12 and I plan to go to
      college and major in something
      in the computer science field.
      Currently, I am learning SQL and
      Python to build and display data and
      data tables.
